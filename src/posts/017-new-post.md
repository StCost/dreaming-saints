# The Death of Reward in Scrolling

Scrolling feeds are designed to hijack the brain’s reward system.  
Each flick of the finger is a lottery ticket: most of what you see is junk, filler, repetition, or shallow noise.  

Your eyes track endless motion—video after video, comment after comment, post after post—while your brain works overtime to filter what matters from what doesn’t. It’s a constant act of sorting: *ignore this, dismiss that, maybe this is worth a glance.*

## The Rare Spark

But the hit rarely comes.  
Out of a thousand pieces of content, maybe one sparks a flicker of real interest or joy.  

That rare spark feels good in the moment, yet it’s so small it doesn’t justify the hours of scanning, straining, and filtering.  
The mind ends up exhausted, overstimulated, and unrewarded.

## The Illusion of Motion

Worse, the scrolling itself keeps your eyes glued to a shifting page.  
Movement lures attention: the screen sliding upward, words and images jumping in and out of view.  

The act of following the text and pictures becomes the activity, not the content itself.  
The brain mistakes motion for meaning, and still feels empty at the end.

## A Possible Alternative

A system where each piece of content has its own page forces you to pause, to choose, to commit attention.  
It’s slower, less overwhelming.  

Even that is not perfect, but it reduces the illusion of endless novelty.  
Continuous feeds, on the other hand, flatten our sense of reward—turning attention into a reflex, not a choice, and draining joy out of the act of looking itself.
